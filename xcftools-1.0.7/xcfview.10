.SH SYNOPSIS
.B \*p
[
.I options
]
.I filename
[
.I layer names
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xcfview
is a wrapper script that uses
.BR xcf2png (1)
or
.BR xcf2pnm (1)
(q.v.) to flatten an XCF image and then displays the flattened
image using a PNG or PPM viewer found using the
.BR mailcap (5)
database.
.SH OPTIONS
Every command-line parameter to
.B xcfview
will be passed through to the underlying
.B xcf2png
or
.B xcf2pnm
command.  Because it is not certain which converter will be used,
the options given should be ones that make sense for both of these:
.so xcfview.1i
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status is 0 in case of success. A nonzero exit status may
either be that of the
.BI xcf2 foo
converter or that of the image viewer.
