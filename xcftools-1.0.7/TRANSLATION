The run-time messages from the program can be localized using standard
GNU gettext tools in the po/ directory. There is no Makefile in po/;
the processing is governed by the main Makefile in the top
directory. Simply use
   make po/xcftools.pot
to update the pot file if necessary.

After creating a po file, add the language code to the definition of
LINGUAS in the master Makefile.in.

The manpo/ directory contains some experimental support for
translating the manpages. Because much text is shared between the
various manpages, the translation is done by po files, a few sentences
at a time, and finished translated manpages are collected at build
time.

Note that the manpo/*.po files are parsed by a very ad-hoc parser in
manpo/mantranslate.pl rather than by the standard gettext support
programs. In particular, the "fuzzy" flag does not prevent an entry
from being used. Also there is no charset handling, so the po files
should be written with the same character set as should be used in the
roff source of the combined man page.

After writing a po file, add the language code to the definition
of MANLINGUAS in the master Makefile.in.
